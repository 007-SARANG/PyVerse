**Modules Used**:

* `random`: For selecting random questions and answers.
* `time`: For adding slight delays between actions to make the game experience more dynamic.

**Game Introduction**:

* The game starts with a welcome message and prompts the player to enter their name.

**Questions and Answers**:

* A list of `questions` and corresponding `answers` is provided.
* Each question also has a list of wrong answers (`wronganswers`) for generating multiple-choice options.

**Question Loop**:

* The game continuously presents questions to the player until they either answer incorrectly or choose to quit.
* For each question, a random question is selected from the list, along with random wrong answers and one correct answer.
* The answer options are then shuffled before being displayed to the player.

**Winning Amount**:

* The player earns progressively higher amounts with each correct answer, starting from â‚¹1,000 and going up to â‚¹1,500,000.
* If the player answers all 10 questions correctly, they win the game and the grand prize.

**Game Termination:**

* The game can end in three ways:
* The player answers incorrectly.
* The player quits by pressing "Q".
* The player answers all 10 questions correctly and wins the maximum amount.

**Feedback:**

* The game provides immediate feedback on whether the player's answer was correct or wrong, and displays their current winnings after each round.
