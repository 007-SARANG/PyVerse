# Brain Tumor MRI Dataset Augmentation using GANs

This project involves augmenting a brain tumor MRI dataset using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The dataset is preprocessed, and a GAN is trained to generate synthetic MRI images. The augmented dataset can aid in improving the performance of machine learning models used for medical image analysis.

---

## Features

- **Dataset Preprocessing**: Converts images to grayscale, resizes them to 128x128, and normalizes pixel values to the range [-1, 1].
- **GAN Architecture**:
  - **Generator**: Upsamples random noise to generate realistic 128x128 grayscale images.
  - **Discriminator**: Distinguishes real images from generated ones.
- **Training**:
  - The GAN is trained using the Binary Cross-Entropy loss.
  - Training progress is tracked with a tqdm progress bar.
- **Augmentation**:
  - Synthetic images generated by the GAN are combined with the original dataset.
  - The augmented dataset is saved for further use.
- **Visualization**: Displays a grid of generated images.

├── brain-tumor-mri-dataset/      # Dataset folder
│   └── Training/                 # Training data with subfolders for each class

├── augmented_mri_images/         # Folder where augmented images will be saved
└── script.py                     # Main script for preprocessing, training, and augmentation
```

---

## How to Use

1. **Set Up Dataset**:
   - Organize the dataset into subfolders for each class (`glioma`, `meningioma`, `notumor`, `pituitary`) under the `brain-tumor-mri-dataset/Training` folder.

2. **Run the Script**:
   - Execute the script:
     ```bash
     python script.py
     ```

3. **Generated Images**:
   - The augmented images will be saved in the `augmented_mri_images/` folder.

4. **View Visualizations**:
   - The script will display a grid of generated images during the process.

## Key Functions

### `load_and_preprocess_images(folder_path, image_size=(128, 128))`
Loads, resizes, and normalizes images from the dataset folder.

### `build_generator()`
Defines the generator model, which creates synthetic images.

### `build_discriminator()`
Defines the discriminator model, which evaluates the authenticity of images.

### `train(dataset, epochs)`
Trains the GAN using the specified dataset and number of epochs.

### `generate_images(num_images)`
Generates new images using the trained generator.

---

## Results

- **Original Dataset**: Number of training images — `x_train.shape[0]`
- **Augmented Dataset**: Number of augmented images — `len(augmented_dataset)`
