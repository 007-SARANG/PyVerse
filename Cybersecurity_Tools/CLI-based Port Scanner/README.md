## **CLI Based Port Scanner**

### **Disclaimer**

This code is purely meant for learning purposes, and not meant to be used with malicious intent.

### üéØ **Goal**

Python Project - This CLI tool allows the user to scan specified ports of a host.

Modules Used:
    1. optparse - to enable command-line arguments in the terminal and their parsing
    2. socket - to interact with the host and their ports
	

### üßæ **Description**

This CLI tool allows the user to scan specified ports of a host, and can be run in a terminal. The user can enter the host's IP address, and the port numbers (separated by comma - do not include any whitespace between commas and numbers). The tool scans ports one by one and returns a summary of findings for each port.

### üßÆ **What I had done!**

1. Imported required libraries.
2. Set up the arguments for the tool using optparse (-H/--Host and -p/--port).
3. Read the user input, and parse them accordingly. 
4. Stored the host IP in a variable, and port numbers in a list.
5. Wrote function for sending a message to a port and checking its response.
6. Wrote a function to iterate through the list of port numbers, and initiate the above scan function for each port.

### üì¢ **Conclusion**

On using the help option, we get the following output:
```
Usage: port-scanner.py [options]

Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -H TGHOST, --Host=TGHOST
                        specify target host
  -p TGPORT, --port=TGPORT
                        specify target port[s] separated by comma
```

After entering a valid IP address for `certifiedhacker.com` and 3 ports - namely 21, 22, 80, the following output is displayed:
```
