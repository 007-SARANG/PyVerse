# AVL Tree Visualizer

## 🎯 Goal
The main goal of this project is to provide an interactive tool for visualizing AVL tree construction in real-time. The purpose is to help users understand how AVL trees are built and maintained, including rotations, balancing, and traversal methods. This tool is ideal for learners and educators looking to explore AVL tree concepts.

## 🧵 Dataset
No dataset is required for this project, as the tree is constructed from user input (either file uploads or manual input).

## 🧾 Description
This project is an interactive web app developed using Streamlit. It allows users to build and visualize an AVL tree step-by-step. Users can either upload a file with numbers or manually enter them, and the app dynamically updates the tree structure. The visualizer provides real-time feedback on the balancing operations (rotations) performed to maintain the AVL properties. The app also displays tree traversals and helps users learn how an AVL tree operates.

## 🧮 What I had done!

Built an interactive web app using Streamlit.
Developed two modes of input: file upload and manual entry.
Implemented real-time tree visualization, where users can observe the AVL tree being constructed dynamically.
Added features to show tree traversals.
Provided feedback on user input and AVL tree balancing operations.

## 🚀 Models Implemented
No machine learning models were used in this project. However, the AVL tree is implemented using a self-balancing binary search tree algorithm. The AVL tree is chosen because of its strict balancing property, which ensures that the tree maintains O(log n) height and guarantees efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations.

## 📚 Libraries Needed

`streamlit` (for creating the web app)

`graphviz` (for graph/tree structure visualization)

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis Results
No exploratory data analysis (EDA) is required for this project, as it does not involve any datasets. However, images of the AVL tree visualizations generated in real-time are included to demonstrate the app's functionality.

## 📈 Performance of the Models based on the Accuracy Scores
As this project does not involve machine learning models, there are no accuracy scores to report. The correctness of the AVL tree is demonstrated through the accurate representation of tree structure and balanced height after each insertion, along with correct traversal results.

## 📢 Conclusion
The AVL Tree Visualizer provides an effective and interactive way to understand the construction and balancing of AVL trees. Through real-time visualization, users can easily follow the operations performed on the tree, including rotations and height balancing, making it an excellent tool for learning AVL trees.
