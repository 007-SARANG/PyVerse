# Single Source Shortest Path

## What is Single Source Shortest Path?

The **Single Source Shortest Path (SSSP)** problem involves finding the shortest paths from a source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph. This problem is essential in various applications, such as routing and navigation, where determining the quickest route is necessary. The graph can be directed or undirected, and the weights on the edges can represent distances, costs, or any other metric.

### Key Characteristics:

1. **Source Vertex**: The starting point from which shortest paths are calculated.
2. **Shortest Path**: The path with the least total weight from the source to any other vertex.
3. **Weighted Graph**: A graph in which edges have weights that can represent costs or distances.

## Applications of Single Source Shortest Path

### 1. **Dijkstra's Algorithm**

**Dijkstra's Algorithm** is a widely used method for solving the SSSP problem in graphs with non-negative edge weights. It employs a greedy approach, continually selecting the vertex with the smallest known distance from the source to explore its neighbors.

- **How It Works**:
  1. Initialize the distance to the source as zero and to all other vertices as infinity.
  2. Create a priority queue to keep track of vertices to explore.
  3. While the queue is not empty:
     - Extract the vertex with the minimum distance.
     - Update the distances to its adjacent vertices if a shorter path is found.
     - Repeat until all vertices have been processed.

- **Time Complexity**: \(O((V + E) \log V)\) when using a priority queue with an adjacency list, where \(V\) is the number of vertices and \(E\) is the number of edges.

- **Use Case**: Dijkstra's algorithm is particularly useful in:
  - **GPS Navigation Systems**: Finding the shortest driving routes.
  - **Network Routing Protocols**: Optimizing data transmission paths in networks.
  - **Game Development**: Implementing AI for pathfinding in dynamic environments.

### 2. **Bellman-Ford Algorithm**

**Bellman-Ford Algorithm** is another algorithm for solving the SSSP problem, capable of handling graphs with negative edge weights. It iteratively relaxes all edges, ensuring that the shortest paths are correctly identified even when negative weights are involved.

- **How It Works**:
  1. Initialize the distance to the source as zero and to all other vertices as infinity.
  2. For each vertex, iterate through all edges and update the distances.
  3. Repeat this process \(V - 1\) times (where \(V\) is the number of vertices).
  4. Optionally, check for negative weight cycles by trying to relax the edges one more time.

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(V \cdot E)\)

- **Use Case**: The Bellman-Ford algorithm is effective for:
  - **Detecting Negative Cycles**: Identifying arbitrage opportunities in financial markets.
  - **Routing Algorithms**: Applications in networks where negative weights may occur, such as adjusting routes based on penalties.
  - **Social Network Analysis**: Analyzing connections with potential negative impacts.

|------------------|---------------------|----------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Dijkstra's**    | \(O((V + E) \log V)\) | Non-negative only    | GPS systems, network routing                   |
