# Maximum Flow

## What is Maximum Flow?

**Maximum Flow** is a concept in network flow theory that deals with finding the greatest possible flow in a flow network from a source node to a sink node while respecting the capacity constraints of the edges. A flow network consists of nodes and directed edges, where each edge has a capacity that indicates the maximum amount of flow that can pass through it. The goal is to determine the maximum flow that can be sent from the source to the sink without exceeding the capacities of the edges.

### Key Concepts:

1. **Flow Network**: A directed graph where each edge has a capacity and the flow must respect these capacities.
2. **Source and Sink**: The source node is where the flow originates, and the sink node is where the flow is intended to reach.
3. **Flow Conservation**: The amount of flow into a node must equal the amount of flow out, except for the source and sink.
4. **Capacity Constraint**: The flow along an edge cannot exceed its capacity.

## Applications of Maximum Flow

### **Ford-Fulkerson Method**

The **Ford-Fulkerson Method** is a popular algorithm for computing the maximum flow in a flow network. It uses the concept of augmenting paths to iteratively increase the flow until no more augmenting paths can be found. The algorithm can be implemented using Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) to identify these paths.

- **How It Works**:
  1. Initialize the flow in all edges to zero.
  2. While there exists an augmenting path from the source to the sink, increase the flow along this path.
  3. Adjust the capacities of the edges along the path to account for the new flow.
  4. Repeat until no more augmenting paths can be found.

- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of the Ford-Fulkerson method depends on the method used to find augmenting paths:
  - With DFS: \(O(max\_flow \cdot E)\) in the worst case.
  - With BFS (Edmonds-Karp): \(O(V \cdot E^2)\).

- **Use Case**: The Ford-Fulkerson method is widely used in various applications, including:
  - **Network Routing**: Optimizing data flow in telecommunications and computer networks.
  - **Transportation Networks**: Managing and optimizing transportation logistics and traffic flow.
  - **Bipartite Matching**: Solving problems like job assignment and matching students to schools.
  - **Circulation Problems**: Ensuring the flow of goods in supply chain management while respecting capacities and demands.
