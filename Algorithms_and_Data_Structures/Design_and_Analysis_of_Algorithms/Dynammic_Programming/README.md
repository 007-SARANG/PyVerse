# Dynamic Programming

## What is Dynamic Programming?

**Dynamic Programming (DP)** is an algorithmic technique used to solve complex problems by breaking them down into simpler overlapping subproblems. Instead of solving the same subproblem multiple times (as in a naive recursive approach), DP stores the results of subproblems in a table (usually an array or matrix) and reuses these results to avoid redundant computation.

### Key Concepts:

1. **Overlapping Subproblems**: A problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems that are solved multiple times. DP optimizes by solving each subproblem only once and storing the solution.
2. **Optimal Substructure**: The solution to a problem can be constructed from the solutions to its subproblems. This property allows DP to build solutions step-by-step.

### Approaches:

- **Top-Down Approach (Memoization)**: Solve the problem recursively and store the results of subproblems in a table.
- **Bottom-Up Approach (Tabulation)**: Solve the problem iteratively by solving subproblems first and storing their results in a table to build up the solution.

## Applications of Dynamic Programming

### 1. **0/1 Knapsack Problem**

The **0/1 Knapsack Problem** is a combinatorial optimization problem where a set of items, each with a weight and a value, are given. The objective is to maximize the total value of the items that can be placed in a knapsack of a given weight capacity.

- **Dynamic Programming Approach**: The problem is solved by considering the value of including or excluding each item and storing the maximum value that can be achieved for each subproblem (based on current capacity and items considered).
- **Steps**:
  1. Create a 2D table where rows represent items and columns represent capacities.
  2. Fill the table by deciding whether to include an item or not.
  3. Use the filled table to determine the maximum value.
  
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(nW)\), where \(n\) is the number of items and \(W\) is the capacity of the knapsack.
  
- **Use Case**: Resource allocation, budgeting, inventory management.

### 2. **Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)**

The **Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)** problem is about finding the longest sequence that appears in the same order in two given sequences. The elements of the LCS donâ€™t need to be contiguous but must appear in the same relative order in both sequences.

- **Dynamic Programming Approach**: The problem is solved by comparing characters from both sequences and building the LCS for each prefix of the sequences, storing results in a 2D table.
  
- **Steps**:
  1. Create a table where rows represent characters of the first sequence and columns represent characters of the second sequence.
  2. Fill the table using the recurrence relation: if characters match, add 1 to the diagonal value; otherwise, take the maximum of the left or top value.
  
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(mn)\), where \(m\) and \(n\) are the lengths of the two sequences.
  
- **Use Case**: DNA sequence analysis, file comparison, version control systems.

### 3. **Matrix Chain Multiplication**

In the **Matrix Chain Multiplication** problem, the goal is to determine the optimal way to multiply a given sequence of matrices. The problem is to find the minimum number of scalar multiplications needed to multiply the sequence of matrices together.

- **Dynamic Programming Approach**: This problem can be solved by recursively breaking it down into smaller problems and storing the results of each subproblem. The idea is to find the best place to split the chain of matrices to minimize the cost of multiplication.
  
- **Steps**:
  1. Create a 2D table where each cell represents the minimum cost to multiply matrices from \(i\) to \(j\).
  2. Fill the table using the recurrence relation that minimizes the number of operations for every possible matrix split.
  
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n^3)\), where \(n\) is the number of matrices.
  
- **Use Case**: Optimization of computer graphics, scientific computing, chain operations in algorithms.

### 4. **Fibonacci Sequence**

The **Fibonacci Sequence** is a classic problem where each number in the sequence is the sum of the two preceding numbers. It can be solved efficiently using dynamic programming by storing the previously computed Fibonacci numbers.

- **Dynamic Programming Approach**: Instead of using the naive recursive method, the problem can be solved iteratively by building up the solution from the base cases.
  
- **Steps**:
  1. Start from the base cases \(F(0) = 0\) and \(F(1) = 1\).
  2. Store the result of each Fibonacci number in an array.
  3. Use the stored values to compute larger Fibonacci numbers.
  
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the position in the Fibonacci sequence.
  
- **Use Case**: Algorithms that require the Fibonacci sequence, financial modeling, biological systems modeling.
