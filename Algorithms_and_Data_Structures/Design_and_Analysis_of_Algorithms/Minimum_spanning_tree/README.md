# Minimum Spanning Trees (MST)

## What is a Minimum Spanning Tree?

A **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)** of a connected, undirected graph is a subset of its edges that connects all the vertices together, without any cycles and with the minimum possible total edge weight. In other words, an MST is a tree that spans all the vertices and minimizes the sum of the weights of the edges included in the tree.

### Key Characteristics:

1. **Spanning Tree**: A tree that includes all the vertices of the graph.
2. **Minimum Weight**: The sum of the weights of the edges in the MST is the smallest possible compared to all other spanning trees.
3. **Uniqueness**: If all edge weights are distinct, the MST is unique; otherwise, there may be multiple MSTs.

## Applications of Minimum Spanning Trees

### 1. **Kruskal's Algorithm**

**Kruskal's Algorithm** is a greedy algorithm used to find the MST of a graph. It works by sorting all the edges in non-decreasing order of their weights and adding edges one by one to the MST, ensuring that no cycles are formed.

- **How It Works**:
  1. Sort all edges of the graph by their weight.
  2. Initialize a forest (a set of trees), where each vertex is a separate tree.
  3. For each edge in the sorted list, check if it forms a cycle with the spanning tree formed so far.
  4. If it doesn’t form a cycle, add it to the MST.
  5. Repeat until there are \(V - 1\) edges in the MST (where \(V\) is the number of vertices).

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(E \log E)\) or \(O(E \log V)\), where \(E\) is the number of edges and \(V\) is the number of vertices.

- **Use Case**: Kruskal’s algorithm is particularly useful in network design problems, such as:
  - **Network Cabling**: Minimizing the cost of connecting different network nodes.
  - **Transportation Networks**: Designing efficient road systems or pipelines.
  - **Cluster Analysis**: Identifying groups in data sets.

### 2. **Prim's Algorithm**

**Prim's Algorithm** is another greedy method for finding the MST, starting from a single vertex and growing the tree by adding the least expensive edge from the tree to a vertex outside the tree.

- **How It Works**:
  1. Initialize the MST with a single vertex (the starting point).
  2. While there are still vertices not included in the MST, select the edge with the minimum weight that connects a vertex in the MST to a vertex outside of it.
  3. Add this edge and the connected vertex to the MST.
  4. Repeat until all vertices are included.

- **Time Complexity**: 
  - Using an adjacency matrix: \(O(V^2)\)
  - Using a priority queue: \(O(E \log V)\)

- **Use Case**: Prim’s algorithm is often used in scenarios like:
  - **Network Design**: Similar to Kruskal’s, especially for dense graphs where it might be more efficient.
  - **Minimum Cost Wiring**: Connecting multiple devices with the least amount of cable.
  - **Game Development**: Constructing terrains and networks in simulations.

## Key Differences Between Algorithms:

| Algorithm   | Time Complexity       | Use Case                                        |
|-------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Kruskal's** | \(O(E \log E)\)       | Efficient for sparse graphs, network design     |
| **Prim's**    | \(O(V^2)\) or \(O(E \log V)\) | Efficient for dense graphs, minimum cost wiring |
