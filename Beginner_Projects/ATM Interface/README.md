# Basic ATM Interface

### ðŸŽ¯ **Goal**
Here's a simple Basic ATM Interface project in Python. This project simulates an ATM where users can check their balance, deposit money, withdraw money, and exit.


### ðŸš€ **How it works**
1. The user is presented with a menu to check balance, deposit money, withdraw money, or exit.
2. Based on the user's input:
   * Check Balance: Displays the current balance.
   * Deposit Money: Adds the entered amount to the current balance.
   * Withdraw Money: Subtracts the entered amount from the balance if there are sufficient funds.
   * Exit: Terminates the program.
   
3. The program continues running until the user chooses to exit.

### **Features**
* Check Balance: See the current account balance.
* Deposit Money: Add money to the account.
* Withdraw Money: Take money from the account if the balance allows.
* Exit: Quit the program.

## ðŸ”§ How to Run

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <project-folder>
   ```

2. Install dependencies (if any) and then run the program:
   ```bash
