# Scientific Calculator with Modern GUI

### 🎯 **Goal**
To create a user-friendly, visually appealing scientific calculator application with a modern graphical user interface using Python and Tkinter.

### 🧾 **Description**
This project implements a Scientific Calculator with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using Python's Tkinter library. It offers basic arithmetic operations and scientific functions in a sleek, modern design. The calculator provides an intuitive interface for performing complex calculations with ease.

### 🧮 **What I had done!**
1. Designed a modern, flat GUI using Tkinter and ttk.
2. Implemented basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
3. Added scientific functions (sin, cos, tan, sqrt, log, exp).
4. Created a custom color scheme and styling for better user experience.
5. Implemented error handling for invalid inputs.
6. Organized the code into a class-based structure for better maintainability.

### 🚀 **Models Implemented**
This project doesn't use specific machine learning models. Instead, it implements:
- Basic arithmetic operations using Python's built-in operators.
- Scientific functions using Python's `math` library.
- GUI components using Tkinter and ttk for a modern look and feel.

### 📚 **Libraries Needed**
- tkinter
- math

### 📊 **Usage**
Run the script using Python:

```
python main.py
```

The calculator window will appear, and you can start performing calculations.

How to Use:
- Click on the number buttons to input numbers.
- Use the operator buttons (+, -, *, /) for basic arithmetic operations.
- For scientific functions (sin, cos, tan, sqrt, log, exp), first enter a number and then click the function button.
- Press '=' to evaluate the expression.
- Press 'C' to clear the display.

### 📢 **Conclusion**
This Scientific Calculator with Modern GUI provides a user-friendly interface for performing both basic and advanced mathematical calculations. Its sleek design and error handling make it suitable for students, professionals, and anyone in need of a reliable calculator application. The project demonstrates the capability of Python and Tkinter in creating functional and visually appealing desktop applications.
