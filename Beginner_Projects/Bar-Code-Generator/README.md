## Barcode Generator
### ðŸŽ¯ Goal
The goal of this project is to create a barcode generator using Streamlit. The application allows users to generate EAN-13, EAN-8, and UPCA barcodes based on a user-provided numeric code, and provides the ability to download the generated barcode image.

### ðŸ§¾ Description
This project is a barcode generator built with Streamlit, providing an easy-to-use interface for generating barcodes. Users can select from multiple barcode formats (EAN-13, EAN-8, UPCA), input the appropriate numeric code, and generate a barcode image. The generated barcode is displayed and can be downloaded as a PNG file.

### ðŸ§® Features Implemented
- Developed a Streamlit interface for selecting barcode types and entering barcode numbers.
- Validated the input based on the selected barcode format.
- Generated and displayed barcodes using the `python-barcode` library.
- Added functionality for users to download the generated barcode image.

### ðŸ“š Libraries Needed
- **Streamlit**: For building the user interface.
- **python-barcode**: To generate the barcodes.
- **base64**: For encoding the barcode image to display and download in the Streamlit app.

### ðŸ“¢ Conclusion
The barcode generator offers a simple and effective way for users to generate and download barcodes in various formats. The app handles input validation and provides a clean interface for creating barcodes, making it a useful tool for generating barcodes on demand.
