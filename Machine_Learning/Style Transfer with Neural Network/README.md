# üé® Style Transfer with Neural Networks üñºÔ∏è

Welcome to the **Style Transfer with Neural Networks** project! In this project, we explore the application of neural networks to perform artistic style transfer, allowing us to blend the artistic style of one image with the content of another. 

This README provides an overview of the project, how to set it up, and the main concepts behind style transfer.

## üìö Project Overview

Style transfer is a technique in deep learning that involves using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to separate and combine the style of one image with the content of another image. This project implements a neural style transfer model using **PyTorch** and **pre-trained VGG19**.

### Key Features:
- Use of **pre-trained neural networks** for feature extraction (VGG19)
- Content loss and style loss based on **Gram matrices**
- Supports custom content and style images
- Optimization with **L-BFGS** optimizer for faster convergence

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup & Installation

To get started with this project, you'll need to install the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision matplotlib Pillow
```

### File Structure:

| File/Folder                           | Description                                           |
|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `Style Transfer with Neural Networks.ipynb` | The main notebook implementing style transfer        |
| `images/`                             | Directory containing sample content and style images  |
| `output/`                             | Folder to store the generated images                  |
| `requirements.txt`                    | List of dependencies                                  |

## üöÄ How to Run

1. **Clone the repository** and navigate to the project folder:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/style-transfer-project.git
   cd style-transfer-project
   ```
2. **Run the Jupyter Notebook** to perform style transfer on your custom images. You can upload your content and style images directly in the notebook.

3. Adjust parameters like `content_weight`, `style_weight`, and `num_steps` to tweak the results according to your preferences.

4. View and save the generated images in the `output/` folder.

## üì∏ Sample Run

- **Content Image**: Defines the structure and objects in the final image.
- **Style Image**: Provides the textures, colors, and patterns.

| Content Image                        | Style Image                        | Output Image                        |
|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| ![Content](|![Style](images/style.jpg)         | ![Output](output/generated_image.jpg) |

## üî¨ Concepts Behind the Project

- **Content Representation**: Extracted from deeper layers of the network to capture high-level structures in the image.
  
- **Style Representation**: Captured using the **Gram matrix** of feature maps, representing correlations between different feature maps.

- **Optimization**: The neural network optimizes a noise image to minimize both **content loss** and **style loss**, blending the content and style.

The total loss function is a combination of content loss and style loss:

\[
L_{\text{total}} = \alpha \cdot L_{\text{content}} + \beta \cdot L_{\text{style}}
\]

Where:

- \(L_{\text{content}}\) represents the difference between the generated image and the content image.
- \(L_{\text{style}}\) captures the stylistic differences between the generated image and the style image.

## üß† Technologies Used

- **Python** üêç
- **PyTorch** for deep learning
- **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive coding
- **Matplotlib** for visualizations

## üìä Parameters & Tuning

You can adjust the following parameters to control the output of the style transfer model:

| Parameter       | Default Value | Description                         |
|-----------------|---------------|-------------------------------------|
| `content_weight` | `1e5`         | Weight for the content loss         |
| `style_weight`   | `1e10`        | Weight for the style loss           |
| `num_steps`      | `300`         | Number of optimization steps        |
| `learning_rate`  | `0.01`        | Learning rate for the optimizer     |
