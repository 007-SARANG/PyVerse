# Translator App

🎯 **Goal**
The goal of this project is to provide a real-time language translation system that captures speech, translates it into a chosen language, and plays the translated speech back to the user.

🧵 **Dataset**
No dataset is required for this project as it uses live speech capture and Google's translation services.

🧾 **Description**
This project allows users to translate spoken language into another language in real time. It captures the user’s voice input, translates it using Google’s translation API, and plays the translation back in audio format using Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS).

🧮 **What I had done!**
- Built a user-friendly interface with Streamlit for language selection and speech input.
- Used the `speech_recognition` library to capture live speech from the microphone.
- Implemented Google Translate for text translation between languages.
- Played back translated speech using `gTTS` and `pygame`.

🚀 **Models Implemented**
No machine learning models were used, but the project leverages Google Translate and Text-to-Speech APIs for translation and speech synthesis.

📚 **Libraries Needed**
- `Streamlit`
  
  Streamlit is an open-source app framework used to create data-driven web applications in Python. It simplifies building interactive and real-time applications for machine learning, data science, and more by requiring minimal code.
- `SpeechRecognition`

  SpeechRecognition is a Python library that provides an easy way to work with speech-to-text conversion. It supports several engines and APIs for speech recognition and allows developers to process audio input into text seamlessly.
- `googletrans`

  Googletrans is a free and unlimited Python library that enables easy interaction with the Google Translate API. It supports automatic language detection and translation between a wide variety of languages.
- `gTTs`

  gTTS is a Python library and CLI tool to interface with Google’s Text-to-Speech API. It allows the generation of speech from text using Google’s TTS engine and supports multiple languages.
- `Pygame`

  Pygame is a cross-platform set of Python modules designed for writing video games. It includes computer graphics and sound libraries that help create fully functional multimedia applications, including games.
