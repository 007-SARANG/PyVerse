# Translator App

🎯 **Goal**
The goal of this project is to provide a real-time language translation system that captures speech, translates it into a chosen language, and plays the translated speech back to the user.

🧵 **Dataset**
No dataset is required for this project as it uses live speech capture and Google's translation services.

🧾 **Description**
This project allows users to translate spoken language into another language in real time. It captures the user’s voice input, translates it using Google’s translation API, and plays the translation back in audio format using Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS).

🧮 **What I had done!**
- Built a user-friendly interface with Streamlit for language selection and speech input.
- Used the `speech_recognition` library to capture live speech from the microphone.
- Implemented Google Translate for text translation between languages.
- Played back translated speech using `gTTS` and `pygame`.

🚀 **Models Implemented**
No machine learning models were used, but the project leverages Google Translate and Text-to-Speech APIs for translation and speech synthesis.

📚 **Libraries Needed**
- `streamlit`
- `speech_recognition`
- `googletrans`
- `gtts`
- `pygame`
