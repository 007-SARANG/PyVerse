# Project Title
Predicting Academic Performance from Student Lifestyle Habits using Regression

# Description
This project aims to build a regression-based machine learning model to predict students’ academic performance based on their lifestyle and study habits. Using the publicly available dataset Student Habits vs Academic Performance, the model will analyze factors such as sleep patterns, study time, screen time, physical activity, and dietary habits to determine their impact on GPA (Grade Point Average).

# Objectives
-Clean and preprocess the dataset for effective regression analysis

-Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and correlations

-Build multiple regression models (Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, etc.)

-Evaluate models using metrics such as R² score, MAE, RMSE

-Select the best-performing model and optimize it

-Visualize the relationship between key habits and academic scores


# Why this Project?
Understanding how lifestyle affects academic outcomes can help students make data-driven decisions to improve their performance. This project bridges machine learning with educational insights and contributes to the open-source ecosystem by providing a reproducible, beginner-friendly regression case study.

# Skills Required
-Python

-Pandas, NumPy

-Scikit-learn

-Matplotlib / Seaborn
