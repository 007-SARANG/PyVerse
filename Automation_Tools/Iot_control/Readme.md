# IoT Device Control Using MQTT and Python

This project demonstrates how to control IoT devices using the MQTT protocol with Python. It uses the `paho-mqtt` library to publish messages to an MQTT broker, which are then used to control an IoT device.

## Features

- **Secure Communication**: Utilizes TLS/SSL for secure communication with the MQTT broker.
- **Dynamic Topic Management**: Supports dynamic subscription and publishing to topics.
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Robust error handling for connection issues and message delivery failures.
- **Logging**: Detailed logging for monitoring and troubleshooting.
