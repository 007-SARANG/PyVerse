# Resort and City Hotel Demand Forecasting and Operational Insights

This project involves using historical booking data to forecast demand for the next 6 months. It provides recommendations for expanding hotel capacity, maximizing revenue, and ensuring smooth operational flow based on data-driven insights.

## Project Overview

This analysis aims to:

1. **Forecast hotel demand** for the next 6 months using machine learning models, allowing the hotel owner to make informed decisions about room expansion and operational adjustments.
2. **Provide recommendations** on additional revenue streams based on guest behavior patterns and historical footfall data.
3. **Offer operational advice** to ensure smooth daily resort operations, optimizing staffing, room management, and guest satisfaction.


### Key Objectives

1. **Forecasting Demand**: Use time series analysis and regression techniques to predict footfall and room occupancy trends for the next 6 months.
2. **Revenue Optimization**: Explore customer preferences and booking behaviors to suggest upselling opportunities (e.g., room upgrades, spa packages, dining deals).
3. **Operational Efficiency**: Provide insights on peak booking periods and cancellations to optimize staff scheduling and resource allocation.

## Methods

- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess data to ensure accurate modeling. Handle missing values, outliers, and categorical variables.
- **Forecasting Models**: Use machine learning models such as:
  - Linear Regression
  - ARIMA/SARIMA for time series forecasting
  - Prophet (if appropriate for more complex seasonality trends)
- **Revenue and Operational Insights**:
  - Cluster analysis to identify customer segments and high-value guests.
  - Decision tree analysis to understand factors driving cancellations.
  - Statistical analysis of customer spending to recommend new services or packages.

## Results

1. **Demand Forecast**: Predicts the number of room bookings over the next 6 months, identifying high and low-demand periods.
2. **Revenue Growth Opportunities**: Provides suggestions on upselling services, based on customer behavior (e.g., weekend promotions, special event bookings).
3. **Operational Insights**: Recommends peak staff scheduling times and additional rooms or resources needed during high-occupancy periods.

## Recommendations

- **Expand Rooms**: Based on forecasted demand, an expansion of `X%` in room capacity is advised, especially for peak seasons (e.g., summer holidays, festivals).
- **Upselling Services**: Focus on high-value guests by offering personalized deals, spa services, or room upgrades based on preferences.
- **Smooth Operations**: Automate guest check-ins/check-outs during peak times, adjust staff schedules to match forecasted demand, and preemptively manage cancellations.

## Conclusion

This analysis provides a data-driven approach to help the resort owner expand rooms, increase revenue, and streamline operations. By understanding customer behavior and future booking trends, the owner can make strategic decisions that ensure long-term success.
